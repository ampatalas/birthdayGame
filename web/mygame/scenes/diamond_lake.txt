		You travel without Lea. It isn't very hard, because she trained you well. You miss her sometimes, but you feel like your decision was a correct one. Your first destination is The Diamond Lake.

		When you reach it, it's a middle of the night. You hide under the trees and have a small nap.
		*page_break

		You wake up from your map upon hearing a weird noise. You can hear someone walking nearby your tree... What do you do?
		*choice
			#I pick up my sword, ready to face whoever is coming.
				The person who bothered you is a young boy, about your age. His hair is dark and messy, and so are his eyes. He nearly jumps in the spot, seeing your sword. "What are you doing here?" He asks. "This is my spot."
				*choice
					#"Really. Because it isn't signed anywhere."
						*goto talk_with_boy

					#"I'm sorry. I'll move somewhere else."
						He sighs. "It's alright... But please, hide that sword?" He raises his arms. "See? No weapon on me."
						*choice
							#You are weary. You keep it, just in case.
								"Be smart about it, and I won't use it," you say.
								*goto sword_talk
							#You hide your sword.
								"If you do anything stupid..." You hide your sword.

								*label sword_talk
								"So, what does make this spot yours?" You ask.

								*label talk_with_boy
								He blushes. "It's just... I always sleep in this area when I visit the lake."

								"You visit it often?" You ask. "Do you have any buissnes in here?"

								"You could say so," he says. "My mother was buried nearby. Every year, on the anniversary of her death, I travel here to pay my honors and leave some flowers."

								"Is it safe? You're so young..."

								He smiles a bit. "So are you."

								"Yes, but unlike you, I carry a big-ass sword." You look him up and down. "I have an offer for you."

								He raises his eyebrow.

								"You clearly know the area," you go on. "I do not. We could travel together - I can protect you, if you'll be my guide."

								He thinks about it for a moment.

								"Deal."
								*finish
			#I hide in the bushes.
				The person who bothered you is a young boy, about your age. He sets up a camp for himself, puts a small fire, and eats a small dinner. It seems like he's going to stay there are night.
				*choice
					#Come out of hiding.
						The boy notices you, and picks up the knife. He realizes his knife is really punny compared to your sword.

						"I'm sorry, Ma'am. Can I help you?" He asks.

						You shake your head with disbelief. "Why is a young boy such as yourself alone in the woods?"

						"I'm no younger than yourself."

						"That can be true - but I'm clearly better prepared for fight."

						The boy sighs. "If you must know - my mother was buried nearby. Every year, on the anniversary of her death, I travel here to pay my honors and leave some flowers. That'd be tomorrow."

						You look him up and down. "How about I go with you?" You suggest. You'd feel much better with the companion, as you never travelled without your sister before. "You'll get protection out of it. Myself - a guide."

						He thinks about it for a moment.

						"Deal." He shakes your hand. "I'm Kale."
						*finish
					#Stay in bushes.
						You don't come out - you fall asleep in your hiding. When you wake up, the boy and his camp are gone.

		You reach the Diamond Lake. It's beautiful, like nothing you've ever seen before. Once you arrive, Lea squeezes your hand. "I've read about it," she says. "The books said it's full of good powers."

		"Like good magic?" You ask, and Lea nods.

		"I can almost feel it," she whispers. "I'm not a witch or anything, but it's certainly there."
		*if knows_parents 
			
			You look at her face, then you look away. "I'm sorry about those parents questions," you say. "I never thought it'd be so... Dark. Now I understand you wanted to protect me. The way you always do." You pause. "I promise to protect you back some day."

			She smiles at you.
		*page_break

		You and Lea travel around the lake. The Diamond Lake is huge, so it's at least a week-long trip. You don't complain, as they views are amazing.
		*page_break

		On day three, you discover a weird cave. It doesn't look dangerous, but Lea warns you, that despite looking quite boring, it might be a magical spot.

		"Or there can be something amazing. Like gold," you are quite interested. You've never seen the inside of the cave before.

		"We can go," Lea says. "But think about it deeply."

		*choice
			#You want to go.
				*finish
			#You decide not to go.
				Lea and you make it to the village nearby. You both decide this place is quite lovely and you want to stay there for few weeks. You set up a camp, buy a chicken, and get all homey. Before you know it, the winter is coming. You both decide to wait until the winter is over in the village. You spend the most wonderful weeks there, with long nights by the fire and big festive dinner around New Years Eve. As the spring comes to life, you move out, and head onto your next adventure!

		You and Alex stay in the village nearby the lake. People give you some weird looks as you book the room, and you start to worry that your parents' influences already got there. Alex isn't any less concerned, but she rubs your arm gently to calm you down.

		"Everything is alright," she says. "Don't worry about them. We're here to relax and have a good time."

		You smile at her. You two head into your room and cuddle each other to sleep.

		*choice
			#I pick up my bow, ready to face whoever is coming.
				The person who bothered you is a young boy, about your age. His hair is dark and messy, and so are his eyes. He nearly jumps in the spot, seeing the arrow in his face. "What are you doing here?" He asks, terrified. "This is my spot."
				*choice
					#"Really. Because it isn't signed anywhere."
						*goto talk_with_boy_r

						He smiles a bit. "So are you."

						You blush, half-flustered and half-angry. "I can handle myself," you say, then you think for a moment. "But I could use some companionship."

						He raises his eyebrow.

						"You clearly know the area," you go on. "I do not. We could travel together - I can protect you, if you'll be my guide."

		Upon arriving to The Diamond Lake, you find the tavern Garret send you to. It's small, but seems nice, and there's a smoke coming out of the chimney. You shiver just at the idea of a warm meal and bed to sleep in - you didn't rest under a roof for a while.

		You knock at the door, but there's no answer, not at first. You know why - there are loud noises from the inside of the tavern. You probably weren't heard. You pick up your staff and bang on the door with it. That finally gets you the reaction you wanted.

		Door is opened by short, red-faced man. "No place!" He says before you even get to tell him anything.

		"Garret send me," you answer.

		"Garret?" Man looks you up and down. "Well... He's a reasonable man." He moves from the door so you can come in.

		*page_break

		When you eat your dinner, a little girl approaches you.

		"Can you show me a magic trick?" She asks.

		*choice
			#You tell her to get lost.
				Girl backs off and runs into one of the rooms. It seems weird to you - did she hang out in the main room alone, without her parent or sibling? You eye the doors for the moment, then get up and move closer to them. You don't hear any sound of conversation in the room. You push the door slightly - and they move under your touch... The room is empty.

				"What are you doing, miss?" The landlord asks. "This is not your room - it's not anyone's room, it's just the place we keep cloths and such."

				You look inside. Indeed, there's nothing but cleaning things.

				"I thought I saw the light there," you say. "I'm probably just tired."

				The man nods. "You better get some rest. It's late."
				*finish
			#You decide to entertain her.
				You show her how you mix the water from your cup and the fire from the fireplace together. She's excited - she claps happily, but other guests give you dirty looks.

				"Sorry, little girl, but that's all from me," you say as you hide your staff.

				"Thank you," she says.

		Upon arriving to The Diamond Lake, you find a cosy tavern. You knock at its doors, and the man opens, but as soon as he sees your staff, he tells you to leave.

		"Please?" You ask. "It's a terribly dark night out there."

		"I'm sure you can make it brighter with some spells of yours," he says before closing the door. 

		*page_break

		You look around - there's a barn nearby, where the tarven guests keep their horses. You go inside - the animals are already asleep. You're not crazy about the smell, but it can do for the night. You eat a small meal and fall asleep in the hay.

		*page_break

		In the morning, the tarven owner nudges you. "How dare you?" He yells. "Sleeping in my barn like this!"

		You hiss. "Careful, old man - unless you want to turn into the frog!"

		He looks at you, suddenly pale. "Please don't!" He says. "You can stay over tonight!"

		*choice
			#Apologize for threatening him.
				*set tavern_entertainer true
				"I'm sorry," you say. "I just got a little nervous... I mean no harm to you or your business. How would you feel about me performing in your tarven tonight? I do know a trick of two."

				He thinks about it. "It actually sounds great," he says. "My guest could use a little entertainment."

				You two shake hands to seal the deal.
				*finish

			#Scare him.
				You start mumbling a spell, and the tavern owner runs away. You giggle to yourself, but get your things and leave. He could come back with some help.
