		Upon arriving to The Diamond Lake, you find the tavern Garret send you to. It's small, but seems nice, and there's a smoke coming out of the chimney. You shiver just at the idea of a warm meal and bed to sleep in - you didn't rest under a roof for a while.

		You knock at the door, but there's no answer, not at first. You know why - there are loud noises from the inside of the tavern. You probably weren't heard. You pick up your staff and bang on the door with it. That finally gets you the reaction you wanted.

		Door is opened by short, red-faced man. "No place!" He says before you even get to tell him anything.

		"Garret send me," you answer.

		"Garret?" Man looks you up and down. "Well... He's a reasonable man." He moves from the door so you can come in.

		When you eat your dinner, a little girl approaches you.

		"Can you show me a magic trick?" She asks.

		*choice
			#You tell her to get lost.
				Girl backs off and runs into one of the rooms. It seems weird to you - did she hang out in the main room alone, without her parent or sibling? You eye the doors for the moment, then get up and move closer to them. You don't hear any sound of conversation in the room. You push the door slightly - and they move under your touch... The door is empty.

				"What are you doing, miss?" The landlord asks. "This is not your room - it's not anyone's room, it's just the place we keep cloths and such."

				You look inside. Indeed, there's nothing but cleaning things.

				"I thought I saw the light there," you say. "I'm probably just tired."

				The man nods. "You better get some rest. It's late."
				*finish
			#You decide to entertain her.
				You show her how you mix the water from your cup and the fire from the fireplace together. She's excited - she claps happily, but other guests give you dirty looks.

				"Sorry, little girl, but that's all from me," you say as you hide your staff.

				"Thank you," she says.

		Upon arriving to The Diamond Lake, you find a cosy tavern. You knock at its doors, and the man opens, but as soon as he sees your staff, he tells you to leave.

		"Please?" You ask. "It's a terribly dark night out there."

		"I'm sure you can make it brighter with some spells of yours," he says before closing the door. 

		*page_break

		You look around - there's a barn nearby, where the tarven guests keep their horses. You go inside - the animals are already asleep. You're not crazy about the smell, but it can do for the night. You eat a small meal and fall asleep in the hay.

		*page_break

		In the morning, the tarven owner nudges you. "How dare you?" He yells. "Sleeping in my barn like this!"

		You hiss. "Careful, old man - unless you want to turn into the frog!"

		He looks at you, suddenly pale. "Please don't!" He says. "You can stay over tonight!"

		*choice
			#Apologize for threatening him.
				*set tavern_entertainer true
				"I'm sorry," you say. "I just got a little nervous... I mean no harm to you or your buissnes. How would you feel about me performing in your tarven tonight? I do know a trick of two."

				He thinks about it. "It actually sounds great," he says. "My guest could use a little entertainment."

				You two shake hands to seal the deal.
				*finish

			#Scare him.
				You start mumbling a spell, and the tavern owner runs away. You giggle to yourself, but get your things and leave. He could come back with some help.
